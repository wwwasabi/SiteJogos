            In Brazil, a lot of people try to save time. In most families, both the husband and the wife work full-time, so their free time is very short and very important to them. They look for quick and convenient ways to do their shopping and other things, so
            they can have free time to enjoy themselves and do the things they really like to do.

            Back in the day people used to go to many different places to buy the things they needed at home. They used to go to the butcher for meat and chicken, to the fruit market for fresh fruit, and to the bakery for bread. Nowadays, most people just go to one
            place to get everything they need. They can buy fruit, vegetables, bread, meat, milk and frozen foods at their local supermarket.
